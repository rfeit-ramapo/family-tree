The application is web-based and allows for the creation, editing, searching, viewing, and sharing of family trees. Each person is represented as a node, with some default options for data to be included. For example, you can edit values for an individual’s first, middle, or last name, change their gender, location, or add an image. Additionally, each node is able to connect to others in the form of a parent-child or partnered relationship. All other nodes’ relationships can be extrapolated from this information. For example, siblings are the other children of your parent(s).
